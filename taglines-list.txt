Dick too bomb
Numbers don’t lie, check the scoreboard
I catch the beat runnin’ like Randy Moss
Gotta keep the peace like a Buddhist
Till I die, I’mma fucking ball
My checks be lookin’ like phone numbers
I'm not a player, I just crush a lot
And that don't make no sense, but baby I'm the shit
Human after all
Spillin’ Ace on my sick J’s
Let’s go on a living spree
Headshots — f*** yo’ vest
Deuce deuce in my bubble goose
I'm gifted — Merry Christmas
My ice brought the goalies in
Hatin' on me will make your situation worse
You got a body to die for, let me murk it
Whole squad on that real shit
