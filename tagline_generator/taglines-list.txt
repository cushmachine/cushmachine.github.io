Dick too bomb
Numbers don’t lie, check the scoreboard
I catch the beat runnin’ like Randy Moss
Gotta keep the peace like a Buddhist
Till I die, I’mma fucking ball
My checks be lookin’ like phone numbers
I'm not a player, I just crush a lot
And that don't make no sense, but baby I'm the shit
Human after all
Spillin’ Ace on my sick J’s
Let’s go on a living spree
Headshots — f*** yo’ vest
Deuce deuce in my bubble goose
I'm gifted — Merry Christmas
My ice brought the goalies in


"Where the obvious meets the impossible"
"I shave with Occam’s Razor"
"I once killed a man, him and all his succubi"
"Talk is cheap"
"My Other Website’s A Startup"
"I’m feeling fat, and sassy"
"Hetero. Genius."
"You are (not) alone"
"In the mood for love"
"And it washes without washing"
"You can eat it, or wear it"
"Turtles all the way down"
"Garbage in, garbage out"
“Heavy is the crown”
